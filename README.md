# Employee Tracker

## Description

- My motivation for creating this project was to make an interface that allowed non developers to easily view and edit a database containing information about their employees.
- While building this project I learned how to use console.map to print messages to the console.
- This project also helped me gain knowledge of the SQL database.

## Installation

To install my project you need to clone my repo to your local computer, open an integrated terminal in the main project folder and run 'npm i' 
which will prompt the download of all of the node packages that the project requires. Once the downloads are complete run 'node server.js' in 
the same integrated terminal to start the CLI. 


## Usage

To use, follow the prompts to do various tasks such as, viewing departments, employees, roles, or adding department, employees or roles.

To exit the CLI you can press 'command C' or press the 'exit' option in the list of actions.
